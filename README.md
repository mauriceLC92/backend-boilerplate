# backend-boilerplate

A boilerplate for creating an API using NodeJs that already has configurations set up for TypeScript and Express.

It tries to conform to the philiosohpies set out by https://12factor.net/

It is meant to be easy to clone and get going with.

// todo
Add section on folder structure and how the flow from domain layer to actions to http works and reasoning for it

// Mention section on use of database and knex - Add sections on seed files and migrations





Disclaimer: This format was constructed by seeing how it done in my workplace and after becoming really familiar with it, I decided it would be a good idea to create a boilerplate for future projects.
